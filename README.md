# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to take our previous created, dynamic workpage and provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. The intent was to allow users the opportunity to filter for multiple criteria at the same time (date, city, state, country, & shape).

## Results
The outcome of our work provides the user the opoprtunity to filter for multiple criteria, as exhibited in the following screenshot of the page.:

The user can filter using multiple searches simultaneously such as date, city, state. This can allow the user to search the database as broadly or meticuously as desired. Each additional filter can be compiled simultaneously as seen in the example/images below:

### Filter Search on Date (1/1/2020)

### Filter Search on Date (1/1/2020) & State (CA)

### Filter Search Date (1/1/2020) & State (CA) & City (El Cajon)

## Summary
This updated filter allows the user a variety of options to explore a broader database. However, the setup also shows some general drawbacks. First, needs to complete a fair amount of independent searches to determine the scope of their search (a possibility for time waste in familiarization with platform). Secondly, the dataset itself is not cleaned, as exhibited in 'Duration' column of the final image above (6 minutes vs 15 min). This may lead to missed datapoints.
